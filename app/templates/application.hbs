{{!You may remember that it was generated for us when we first created the app but we deleted it.
Now, it's time for us to bring it back!
This template is special in that it does not have its own URL and cannot be navigated to on its own.
Rather, it is used to specify a common layout that is shared by every page in your app.
This is a great place to put site-wide UI elements, like a nav-bar and a site footer.
While we are at it, we will also add a container element that wraps around the whole page,
as requested by our designer for styling purposes.}}

<div class="container">
  <NavBar /> {{!Ember provides the alternative self-closing shorthand to save you some typing}}
  <div class="body">
    {{outlet}}
    {{!The { { outlet } } keyword denotes the place where our site's pages should be rendered into,
     similar to the { { yield } } keyword we saw earlier.}}
  </div>
