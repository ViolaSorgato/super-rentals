{{!<LinkTo> is an example of a component in Emberâ€”you 
can tell them apart from regular HTML tags because they start 
with an uppercase letter. Along with regular HTML tags, 
components are a key building block that we can use to build
 up an app's user interface. 
 
 The AT route=... part is how we pass arguments into the component.}}
